# 🚀 Major upgrade is coming soon!

🔴 **If you are willing to use this project right now, you can use the current version from [v1 branch](https://github.com/Dilshan-H/Oblivion-Inverse/tree/v1). Since Heroku has discontinued the free tier, the project is needed to be migrated to a new platform. But you can use v1 on a self hosted environment or on Heroku paid tier.**

🔴 **Several sections in this README needs to be updated with the new changes.**

Here we have the list of features that are going to be implemented in the next major updates. If you are willing to contribute, you can [check available open issues](https://github.com/Dilshan-H/Oblivion-Inverse/issues) or [open new issues](https://github.com/Dilshan-H/Oblivion-Inverse/issues/new).

🎯️ Oblivion-Inverse is a simple e-mail tracking solution which based on the usage of web beacons or tracking pixels.

> A web beacon (web bug) is a technique used on web pages and emails to unobtrusively (usually invisibly) allow checking that a user has accessed some content. Web beacons are typically used by third parties to monitor the activity of users at a website for the purpose of web analytics or page tagging. They can also be used for email tracking. - Wikipedia

## What can I achieve using this?

Basically using this pixel tracking method you can obtain vast amount of information about the targets. But, when it comes to emails there are few restrictions. For an instance, JavaScripts are not generally allowed in email clients.

- ✅ IP address of the recipient's device (or the proxy)

- ✅️ Request Header - User-Agent (_Browser, Operating System, Device information_)  
  Ex: `Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 11; Nokia G10) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/91.0.4472.88 Mobile Safari/537.36`

- ✅️ Additionally, you can use a Geo Location API to obtain information such as _approximate location, country, ISP ( Internet Service Provider), whether the user is using a VPN/Tor and so on..._ ) [Read how to use a Geo Location API section](#how-to-use-a-geo-location-api)

## Setup & Usage

### Basic Requirements

- Python3 and Pip
- Git

  - [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
  - [Setup Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup)

- Heroku Account & Heroku CLI (or suitable platform)  
  If you're willing to use **Heroku**, [here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python) they have explained all the steps for getting started with python apps.

- Code Editor (such as [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))

### Installation

1. First clone or download this repository as a Zip file to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the directory.

   ```bash
   cd Oblivion-Inverse
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment.

   ```python
   python3 -m venv ./
   ```

4. Activate virtual environment.

   _Linux:_

   ```bash
    source bin/activate
   ```

   _Windows:_

   ```bash
   Scripts\activate
   ```

5. Install dependencies.

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

6. Change the time zone used in `routes.py`:
   (Default value is `Asia/Colombo`)

   ```python
   # Line 38
   TIMEZONE = "Your-Timezone"
   ```

   To choose the correct time zone, you can query all the supported time zones like this;

   ```python
   import pytz
   pytz.all_timezones
   ```

7. As we use Firebase Realtime Database and Firebase Authentication, you have to create a Firebase project and obtain the credentials. Visit [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.  
   Then go to the project settings and click on the `Service Accounts` tab. Then click on the `Generate New Private Key` button. This will download a JSON file containing the credentials. Rename the file to `credentials.json` and place it in the root directory of the project.

8. Now you have to create a new Firebase Authentication user. To do that, you have to go to the `Authentication` tab in the Firebase Console. Then click on the `Set up sign-in method` button. Then click on the `Email/Password` tab and enable it. Then click on the `Users` tab and click on the `Add User` button. Enter the email and password of the user account you want to create. Then click on the `Add User` button.

9. Now you have to create a new Firebase Realtime Database. To do that, you have to go to the `Database` tab in the Firebase Console. Then click on the `Create Database` button. Then select the database location and click on the `Next` button. Then change the rules as follows and click on the `Enable` button:

   ```json
   {
     "rules": {
       "MailTrackData": {
         "Users": {
           "$uid": {
             ".read": "auth !== null && auth.uid === $uid",
             ".write": "auth !== null && auth.uid === $uid"
           }
         },

         "LinkHits": {
           ".read": false,
           ".write": true
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

10. Now go to project settings again and under the **General** tab you can find the `Web API Key`. Take a note of it since we will need it on the next step.

After that you can either test the application in your local machine or setup your selected platform, as you wish.

### Testing/Using on your Local Machine | Network

Before running the application, you have to set the following environment variables: (Just replace the values with your own and run the commands inside the activated virtual environment)

```bash
export FLASK_ENV="development"
export FIREBASE_API_KEY="Your-Firebase-API-Key"
export SECRET_KEY="replace-this-text-with-a-suitable-key"
```

Then run the application using the following command:

```bash
flask run
```

Navigate to `localhost:5000` in your browser.  
If another program is already utilizing port 5000, `Address already in use` error will be displayed.
If that happens you can specify a different port like this:

```bash
flask run --port 5001
```

A login page will be displayed.  
Input your newly created account's email & password and that's it!

## Steps to create a tracking link for your email.

1. Visit the homepage of the app and sign into your account.

| Login Screen

2. First add a suitable title for your message. You can add the subject of the specific email which will make it easier to identified at later times.

3. Then click '**Generate**'

4. Then, you can drag & drop the tracking image to the end of your message body. (**DO NOT copy & paste the image** since it will insert your image as a base64 image to the email body)
   Otherwise, you can manipulate the content of the email body using Developer Tools in browser.

5. Everything's done! Now send your email and wait for the results to appear. (you need to refresh your browser to load new entries)

## How to use a Geo Location API

Using a Geo Location API, you can collect additional information about the recipient such as;

- Approximate location
- Country
- ISP ( Internet Service Provider)
- VPN/Tor Usage ...

In `routes.py` line 70 to 75 contains a simple API usage that can be altered according to your opinions. Please note that **ipwhois** service has certain limitations (like amount of requests) which may eventually cause errors. So, you can choose a better API which fit into your needs.

### Special note about G-Mail

Since Google uses a special technique, "Image Proxies" to deliver images; this pixel based tracking method is not suitable to gather additional information about the recipients who use G-Mail. Instead of recipient's IP address and User-Agent, you will receive Google Image Proxy’s UA (User-Agent) and IP address which looks like this:

`Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:11.0) Gecko Firefox/11.0 (via ggpht.com GoogleImageProxy)`

But, on the bright side, you can still get the resource accessed date and time!

### Why not using cookies for tracking?

Yes, you can set cookies for additional/accurate data collection. But they represent as third party cookies within devices. Most of the web browsers/platforms block such cookies by default. [maybe not Chrome yet 😉] So, it's the death of 3<sup>rd</sup> party cookies.  
**Update:** Since some browsers/platforms allow 3<sup>rd</sup> party cookies, we are going to implement a cookie based tracking method in the future.
